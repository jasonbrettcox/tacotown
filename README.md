This is a simple memory-type game designed to educate the billions of recent immigrants / transplants to Denver about the reality of tacos. Through basic Memory game play, users can learn about different types of authentic ( aka "good") tacos common to this area, but maybe unavailable back home. Users can learn where to find these tacos at taco shops recommended by a Denver native (myself) and find more information / recipes to make their own versions. Users play against the computer. They win once they have cleared the board and they lose when they use up a set amount of guesses.

Stretch goals include multiple difficulty levels and a head-to-head version where users play against each other
